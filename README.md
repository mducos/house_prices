# Quick explanations of the project

## Goal

The task is to predict the sales price for each house (ie the value of the SalePrice variable for each ID in the test set).

## Metric

Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.

## Submission File Format

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Id,SalePrice
1461,169000.1
1462,187724.1233
1463,175221
```
